## Interactive_paper
This Shiny App is an interactive representation of the economic paper 'Empirical analysis on price in Italian mobile telecommunication market: the Iliad effect'. 
This paper has been realized by me and a colleague of mine, Elisabetta Rocchetti, as part of a project for the Advance Microeconomics course. 
It aims to analyse the effect of the entry of Iliad in the Italian mobile telecommunication market and for further knowledge the paper is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QkuVplG0689dmlMeWsrv58dS4LLyCbOJ/view?usp=sharing) .
